Steps of project:-
1. Loading the Dataset:

Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
Downloaded and loaded the "Bank Marketing" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Preprocessing the Data:

Checked for and handled missing values in the dataset.
Encoded categorical variables and convert them into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
Further split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Building the Decision Tree Model:

Initialized the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
Trained the model using the training data.

4. Evaluating the Model:

Made predictions on the test data using the trained model.
Evaluated the model's performance by calculating accuracy, generating a classification report.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a systematic approach to building and evaluating a decision tree classifier for predicting customer purchases, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and aiding in the development of data-driven marketing strategies.
